# Fit-TDS
This repository is dedicated to the fit@TDS software. A python code aiming at the retrieving of material parameter from a TeraHertz time domain spectroscopy (TDS) measurements from a fit in the time domain.

To use the program, you should have a python3 environment, with the packages listed in "requirement.txt" installed.
Then run the file "fit_TDSg.py" with python3 in the fit_TDS folder.


The code is explained in :
