1. There is a problem with the installation of pyOpt package.
--> Did you reboot your computer after installing pyOpt?
Did you look in the Anaconda environment if pyOpt was correctly installed?
Otherwise there may be a problem in the installation of MinGW fortran compiler. 
Installation via anaconda prompt does not always work, sometimes you have to download it directly from google to install it. 
The following link may be useful to you: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

2. Is there any specific form requirement for the data?
--> The data is in .txt. It just takes two columns (time and the electric field). 
Care must be taken that the time window is the same in the case of the reference and the sample.

3. Is it possible to just eliminate the FP effect without using the optimization part?
--> You can choose to take the FP effect into account or not during your optimizations, but it will not be possible to eliminate it. 
The FP effect is very useful so that the software can find the right parameters when optimizing, it is generally advisable to keep it. 
If you don't want to have the FP, you can cut your time trace and do the fitting without.

4. How to choose the parameters' values ?
--> You can do a first test using no oscillator to fit only the permittivity and the thickness in order to have an idea of what to expect. 
Then introduce one or more oscillators in a given model. For the parameters of your oscillator, you have to put a central value then an interval with a minimum and a maximum. 
The parameters must be chosen in such a way as to guide fit@TDS. If you put values too far from reality it would be more difficult to fit. 
We advise you to rely on the literature if the data is already available.
You can try to put different values, submit and click on preview to better understand the physical background of these parameters.
As your optimizations progress, you will be able to refine your intervals and your values.
