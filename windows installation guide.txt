fit@TDS Installation guide for windows


To use the fit@TDS code on Windows one will need Python version 2.7 or higher (<=3.7) with a number of properly installed packages:
NumPy - http://www.numpy.org/
pyOpt - https://github.com/madebr/pyOpt and http://pyopt.org/ (we hope that this website will be available again soon)
pyswarm - https://pythonhosted.org/pyswarm/

You will also need to have installed:
- Microsoft MPI: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57467
- Visual C++ Build Tools 2015: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126

We recommend you to install Anaconda3 with python 3.7 to have a less complicated installation process.

I) Easy installation

	This way only works if you are using your root environement in anaconda and the installation path of Anaconda is C:\ProgramData\Anaconda2.
        If you created a new environement go to "II) Manual installation".
	For unexperienced Python users (or for the lazy ones) we propose the fallowing procedure to prepare your PC to run the code on it:

	- If you have Anaconda3 with python3 (<=3.7):
	  1) Donwload the following package: https://github.com/madebr/pyOpt
	  2) Extract it in the fit@TDS folder.
	  3) Run "PackagesInstallerPython3" with admin privileges.
	  5) Follow the instructions.
	  4) If you did not encounter problems your PC is ready to use fit@TDS. If you encounter some problems go to the next section to see how to do a manual installation.

	- If you have Anaconda2 with python2:
	  1) Run "PackagesInstallerPython2" with admin privileges.
	  2) Follow the instructions.
	  3) If you did not encounter problems your PC is ready to use fit@TDS. If you encounter some problems go to the next section to see how to do a manual installation.


	- If none of this files work it may be because you have Anaconda3 instead of Anaconda2, in that case try changing "Anaconda2" for "Anaconda3" in the files with a text editor.

II) Manual installation

	1) Check that Python and/or Anaconda are not installed on your PC, otherwise we advise to uninstall the existing version so on not to get any misleading dependencies after the following steps. Reboot the PC.

	2) We advise to use Anaconda - a free and open source distribution of the Python programming language, which includes a number of useful programs and allows an easy package management.
	Download the Anaconda installer with a Python version inferior or equal to 3.7 for Windows respecting the bit architecture of your processor: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

	3) Run the installer. We advise to do it under administrator rights. We suggest to install anaconda for all users on the PC and to accept the destination folder (normally C:\ProgramData\Anaconda2) proposed by the installer. 
	We also suggest not to accept any of the advanced options or add-ons during the installation process. Reboot the PC after the installation is over.

	4) Run Anaconda. Open the Environments menu. Check that the NumPy package is already installed.

	5) Through the Environments menu find and install the following packages:
	* mpi4py (for parallel computing)
	* Swig compiler (version 1.3 and higher)
	* MinGW compiler (other c/FORTRAN compiler may also be used)
	* Tkinter (for GUI)
	[If this step does not work properly, one can add the package using the anaconda prompt and these command lines :
	conda install -c anaconda Swig
	conda install -c anaconda MinGW
	pip install mpi4py
	conda install -c anaconda tk
	If you have problem with installation of mpi4py, fit@tds will work perfectly without, this is just an option, please just commant the line with comment # this can be commented if mpi4py was not installed successfully]


	6) Anaconda distribution includes the Anaconda Prompt which we suggest to use for the installation of the pyOpt and pyswarm packages:
	pyOpt is an object-oriented framework for formulating and solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems. It can be installed as follows:
	- If you have python 2 you can run the following command in the terminal: conda install -c mutirri pyopt
	- If you have python 3 you need to do as follow:
		1) Donwload the following package: https://github.com/madebr/pyOpt
		2) Extract the folder "pyOpt-master" in a known location.
		3) Open the terminal (anaconda prompt) and run the following command: cd "Path to pyOpt-master"
		4) Run the following command: python setup.py install
     
	The pyswarm package is a gradient-free, evolutionary optimization package for python that supports constraints. 
	Your Anaconda distribution normally includes the pip package, so install the pyswarm package by the following command:
	pip install --upgrade pyswarm

	7) Reboot the computer.

	8)unzip the fit@tds files (fit@TDS.py, epsillon3.py and finalplot.py)

	Congratulations, now you should be able to run the fit@tds code! (If you have issues see in the section below)



III) Using fit@TDS
	
	1) From file (easy way)

	   This way only works if you are using your root environement in anaconda and the installation path of Anaconda is C:\ProgramData\Anaconda2.
           If you created a new environement go to the next section "2) From the terminal (AnacondaPrompt)"
	   You can use the "FitTDSeasy" and follow the instructions to use fit@TDS.
	   

	
	2) From the terminal (AnacondaPrompt)

	   To do so one can use the Spyder environment (also included to the Anaconda distribution) or just to run the the fit@TDS.py by the following two commands in the Anaconda Prompt:
	   Write the path to the folder containing the fit@TDS.py file, for example by
	   cd C:\Users\Admin\Documents\fit@tds
	   Run the file:
	   python fit@tds.py

	   If you want to use parallelization instead of the last command run:
	   mpiexec -n (number of processors) python fit@TDS.py



IV) ISSUES

	1) h_start = Bcast(h_start, root=0)
	   UnboundLocalError: local variable 'Bcast' referenced before assignment

	   This is a common error because the pyOpt library installed has a little bug with the pyAlpso script.
	   To correct this you need to go to the folder where you installed anaconda (usually C:\ProgramData\Anaconda2 or C:\Users\"your user"\.conda\envs\"your environement" if you have different environements)
	   Then go to "path anaconda"\Lib\site-packages\pyopt\pyALPSO and open the alpso_spm.py script (you may need admin privileges to modify the file).
	   Finally change the line 108 from "elif (mpi4py.__version__[0] == '1'):" to "else".
